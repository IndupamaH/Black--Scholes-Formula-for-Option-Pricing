    "The Black-Scholes formula is a mathematical model used for calculating the theoretical price of European-style options. It was developed by economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973. The formula takes into account various factors such as the current stock price, the option's strike price, the time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of the underlying stock. \n",

    "\n",

    "* **Continuous Trading**: The model assumes that it is possible to buy or sell any amount of the underlying asset at any time. This implies continuous trading without transaction costs or market frictions, which may not be true in real-world situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Constant Risk-Free Interest Rate** ($r$) : The risk-free interest rate is assumed to be constant and known throughout the option's life. In practice, interest rates can change, and the assumption of a constant rate simplifies the calculations.\n",

    "* **No Dividends**: The original Black-Scholes model assumes that the underlying stock does not pay any dividends during the life of the option. However, there are modifications of the model that incorporate dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Log-Normal Distribution of Stock Prices**: The model assumes that the distribution of stock prices follows a log-normal distribution. This implies that stock prices cannot become negative and that extreme price movements are less likely than in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **European-Style Options**: The model is specifically designed for European-style options, which can only be exercised at expiration. This assumption simplifies the model but may not be suitable for American-style options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No Transaction Costs or Taxes**: The model assumes that there are no transaction costs, taxes, or other frictions associated with buying or selling the underlying asset or the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient Markets**: The model assumes that markets are efficient and that all information relevant to the option is already reflected in the stock price. This assumption is part of the efficient market hypothesis.\n"
